      "This project generated us fake images of dogs learnt from real ones that exists using Generative Adversial Networks. Our project is based on the concept of GAN(Generative Adversarial Networks). We have used a dataset with images of different variety of dogs. We have trained our model to differentiate between fake and real dog images using GAN.",
